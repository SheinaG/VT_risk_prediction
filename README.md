VT is a dangerous heart arrythmia as it the most common arrythmia leading to primary cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death, Early detection and treatment of the arrythmia can prevent death.

In this repository we try to utilize ML tools to the task of risk prediction of VT from non VT ECG segments, for a very imbalance data.
